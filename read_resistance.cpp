/** 	filename: gpioApp.cpp
*
*	A. Write an application named gpioApp.cpp that uses the textbookâ€™s classes LED and GPIO and
*	your AnalogIn class to control gpio pins. The application shall perform the following tasks and
*	then exits:
*	1. Turn on user LEDs number 1 and 3.
*	2. Flash user LED 2 three times.
*	3. Read the temperature sensor and display its value.
*	4. Read the push button on P8.16.
*	5. If the push button in item 4 was pushed, turn on the LED on P9.12.
*
*	This program takes no arguments. To run call gpioApp
